# sumoRobots
This repository is dedicated to the firmware of autonomous 3 kg sumo robots from one of the Feg Robótica's team programmer.
Each year I am responsible for programming distinct robots in the Winter Challenge competition, as follows:  
[2017]: Lobo (3 kg autonomous robot, 4th place) and Bernadete (3 kg autonomous robot, 9th place);  
[2018]: Metalgarurumon (3 kg autonomous robot, the tournament has not yet occurred).  
This repository will hold the firmware for the last year competition and the upcoming on 2018.
